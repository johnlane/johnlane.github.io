John Lane launched this website at [projects.johnlane.ie](http://projects.johnlane.ie) as a central place for information about his published work.

The content is mostly written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and themed by [Poole](http://getpoole.com). The end-result is published on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

The phrases *Twisty Little Projects* and *A twisty maze of little projects* have something to do with a [computer game](http://line-mode.cern.ch/www/proxy?url=http://www.web-adventures.org/cgi-bin/webfrotz?s=Adventure) that people of a certain age might fondly recall.
